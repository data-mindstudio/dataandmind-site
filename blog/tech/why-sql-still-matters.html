  <h1>Why SQL Still Matters in 2026 (and Beyond)</h1>

  <p>
    Every few years, someone declares that SQL is “dying.”
    And yet, every serious data system still runs on it.
  </p>

  <h2>SQL Is the Contract Layer</h2>
  <p>
    SQL acts as the contract between raw data and business logic.
    Whether you're using BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, or Postgres,
    SQL is the language that defines truth.
  </p>

  <h2>Abstractions Still Compile to SQL</h2>
  <p>
    Modern tools may hide SQL, but they don’t replace it.
    BI tools, transformation frameworks, and orchestration layers
    all compile down to SQL at execution time.
  </p>

  <h2>Performance Still Depends on SQL</h2>
  <p>
    Poor joins, incorrect aggregations, and inefficient filters
    cause real production issues. Understanding SQL deeply
    remains the fastest way to debug and optimize pipelines.
  </p>

  <h2>SQL Scales With You</h2>
  <p>
    As data volumes grow and systems evolve, SQL knowledge
    compounds. It transfers across platforms, tools, and clouds.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>
    SQL is not just a query language — it’s a way of thinking
    about data. That’s why it still matters, and why it will
    continue to matter for years to come.
