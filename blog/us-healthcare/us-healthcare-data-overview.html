  <h1>Understanding US Healthcare Data: A High-Level Overview</h1>

  <p>
    The US Healthcare system generates enormous volumes of data.
    Understanding how this data flows is critical for anyone working
    in healthcare analytics, engineering, or operations.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Participants</h2>
  <p>
    At a high level, the system consists of payers (insurance companies),
    providers (hospitals, clinics, physicians), members (patients),
    and regulatory bodies.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Data Domains</h2>
  <p>
    Healthcare data typically falls into domains such as enrollment,
    eligibility, claims, billing, and provider data. Each domain
    serves a specific operational purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Transaction-Based Workflows</h2>
  <p>
    Much of US Healthcare data moves through standardized transactions,
    enabling interoperability between disparate systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Accurate, timely healthcare data impacts patient care, billing,
    compliance, and operational efficiency. Poor data quality
    leads directly to financial and clinical risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    Future articles will explore individual data domains, common
    failure points, and how data engineering supports healthcare
    operations at scale.
